      summarize: `This repository is a modern web application built with React and TypeScript. 

**What is React?** React is a JavaScript library that helps you build interactive user interfaces by breaking them into reusable pieces called components.

**What is TypeScript?** TypeScript adds type safety to JavaScript, meaning you declare what type of data each variable should hold (like numbers, text, etc.).

The main features include:
- File browsing: Navigate through project files
- Code analysis: Understand what code does
- AI-powered explanations: Get help understanding code

The project uses Tailwind CSS (a styling tool) and follows best practices for organizing code into components.`,

      contribute: `Contributing is a great way to learn! Here's a beginner-friendly guide:

1. **Fork the repository**: Click "Fork" to create your own copy

   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Skills: CSS, React state

2. **Improve mobile responsiveness** - Fix layout on phones
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Skills: CSS, responsive design

3. **Add unit tests** - Write tests for utility functions
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Skills: Testing, JavaScript

4. **Update documentation** - Improve README and comments
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Skills: Writing, markdown

Start with the "Easy" ones to get comfortable with the codebase!`,

      explain: `This file contains important logic for the application.

**What does it do?**
It exports a React component - think of components as reusable building blocks for your UI.

**Key concepts:**
- **useState**: Lets the component remember information (like whether a button was clicked)
- **useEffect**: Runs code when the component loads or when data changes
- **Event handling**: Responds to user actions like clicks
- **Rendering**: Displays the UI on screen

**In simple terms:** This component is like a smart container that displays information and responds to what the user does.`,

      summarize: `This repository is a modern web application built with React and TypeScript, implementing a component-based architecture with state management and API integration.

**Architecture Overview:**
- React components with hooks (useState, useEffect)
- TypeScript for type safety and better IDE support
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Modular file structure with separation of concerns

**Key Features:**
- File browsing with tree navigation
- Code analysis and syntax highlighting
- AI-powered code explanations

3. **Add error boundaries** - Improve error handling in components
4. **Optimize performance** - Implement code splitting and lazy loading
5. **Enhance testing** - Add integration and E2E tests

These issues require understanding of React patterns, performance optimization, and testing strategies.`,

      explain: `This file implements a React component with the following structure:

**Component Architecture:**
- Uses functional component pattern with hooks
- Manages local state with useState
- Handles side effects with useEffect
